				<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
				<p class="aboutme-section-description">
					I am a Statistician by training, a skilled Tailor by craft,
					a Musician by passion, and a Project Manager by profession.
					Throughout my journey, I have discovered that numbers reveal
					patterns, fabrics tell stories, music carries emotion, and
					well-managed projects turn ideas into impact. This unique
					blend has shaped how I approach life and work: with
					precision, creativity, harmony, and structure. Whether I am
					analyzing data to guide decisions, designing garments that
					inspire confidence, creating melodies that uplift, or
					managing projects to successful execution, my focus remains
					the same â€” bringing clarity, style, and joy into the lives
					of others. With the right balance of skill, purpose, and
					faith, I believe we all have the capacity to transform our
					gifts into tools that serve people and shape the future.
					Stay tuned to see the projects I create, the styles I
					design, and the melodies I share below!
